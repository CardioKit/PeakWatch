# Data

This is a short guide that outlines the process of supplying data for analysis within the Jupyter notebook:

1. Launch the PeakWatch application on your iOS device.
2. Navigate to the home screen and hit the export button positioned in the upper-right corner.
3. Transmit the data to the analysis-executing computer, e.g. via a Bluetooth interface or an alternative method of your choosing.
4. Integrate the acquired data into the designated folder for seamless access by the analysis script.
